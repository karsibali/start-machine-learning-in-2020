# [Start Machine Learning in 2020 - Become an expert for free!](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/start-machine-learning-in-2020-become-an-expert-from-nothing-for-free-f31587630cf7)

## A complete guide on how to start learning machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) in 2020 without ANY background in the field.

This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it can certainly be done without it with a little more reading and practice.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## Practice, practice, and practice!<a name="Practice"></a>
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. And this applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice.

Fortunately, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) exists. This website is full of free courses, tutorials and competitions. You can join competitions for free and just download their data, read about their problem and start coding and testing right away! You can even earn money from winning competitions and it is a great thing to have on your resume. This may be the best way to get experience while learning a lot and even earn money!

You can also create teams for kaggle competition and learn with people! I suggest you join a community to find a team and learn with others, it is always better than alone. Check out the next section for that.
